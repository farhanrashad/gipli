General Explanation

The list expression works to filter the records of the related model by using a specified field or fields. It follows a particular pattern to dynamically fetch and map records based on the relationships defined within your Odoo models.

Example Usage

    - **Simple Field Reference**: 'uom_id'
       - This will directly use the field 'uom_id' to filter and retrieve related records.
    - **Nested Field Reference**: 'uom_id.category_id'
       - This will first retrieve the 'uom_id' field and then filter based on the related 'category_id' field.

Detailed Behavior

    - **Single Field Reference**: 
       - If the expression contains a single field (e.g., 'uom_id'), the system will directly look for this field in the specified model and filter records based on its values.
    - **Nested Field Reference**: 
       - If the expression contains a nested field (e.g., 'uom_id.category_id'), the system will first look for the 'uom_id' field in the model, then find the related 'category_id' field, and filter records based on these nested values.

Step-by-Step Process

    1. **Identify Source Field**: The system identifies the field specified in the list expression.
    2. **Check Model Relationships**: 
       - For a single field (e.g., 'uom_id'), it checks if this field is present in the service items and retrieves its values.
       - For a nested field (e.g., 'uom_id.category_id'), it first retrieves the 'uom_id' values, then checks the related model for 'category_id' values.
    3. **Filter Records**:
       - For 'uom_id', it filters records based on the 'uom_id' values.
       - For 'uom_id.category_id', it filters records based on the 'category_id' values of the 'uom_id' related records.

Example Scenario

    1. **Expression**: 'uom_id.category_id'
       - The system will:
         - Check the model of 'uom_id'.
         - Find the 'category_id' field within the related model of 'uom_id'.
         - Filter and sort records based on 'category_id'.
    2. **Expression**: 'uom_id'
       - The system will:
         - Directly filter and sort records based on the 'uom_id' values.

Important Notes

    - Ensure that the fields specified in the expression are correctly defined in your models and service items.
    - Nested fields should follow the pattern 'field_name.related_field_name' to correctly map and filter records.
    - If the field names or model relationships are incorrect, the system may not be able to filter records as expected.
