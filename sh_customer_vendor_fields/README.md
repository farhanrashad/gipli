About
============
In the previous version of odoo, there is a boolean field in contacts for differentiating between customer and vendor but in odoo13 those fields are removed so it makes some difficulty for selecting customers and vendors. That's why we created this module it will help you to create customer and vendor separately as like create customer and vendor in the previous version of odoo. This module provides two different boolean fields 1. Is Customer. 2. Is Vendor. Now you can work with customers and vendors just like previous versions.


Installation
============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart odoo service (sudo service odoo-server restart).
3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list. 
5) search module name and hit install button.
